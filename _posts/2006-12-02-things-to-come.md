title: Things to come

For some time, I've been writing notes on what I would blog about, were I to
have a blog.  Well, I have a blog now.  Given the blog name, it should come as
no surprise that forthcoming posts will bore family members within an inch of
death.  Maybe others will derive some value though.

Without further delay, here's an incomplete list of topics to come:
- Garbage collection: Fast suspend/resume with critical section support
- Effects of multi-core computing on programming language design
- Why virtual machines matter
- Unicode's impact on programming language design
- Phylogenetic inference: Star decomposition is biased!

This is the sort of stuff that keeps me up at night.  If nothing else, it can
put others to sleep at night.
